# OF Intention Repeater (Orgonite France Intention Repeater)
Intention repeater research project inspired by https://github.com/tsweet77

FIRST EXPERIMENTS (7th of January, 2020)

My first tests show the following (with the program running on onlinedgb.com and repl.it) :

With the simplest intention "LOVE", it seems to produce a blue hole in the sky after at least 4 hours of running this program. That still needs to be confirmed. Why ? Because there are orgonite towerbusters that are in the area so I cannot confirm that the program itself has induced the blue hole, or that the towerbusters induced that, or both...

An important test to do is to run this program for 4 hours in a non-gifted area in order to know if it is effective alone.

Anyway, if you have orgonite around, then I think that it works in combination with the orgonite devices (eg. towerbusters). That still needs confirmation !

NEW EXPERIMENTS (8th of January, 2020)

the "OF Intention Repeater.exe" sends the word "LOVE" as an intention (in the Aether/Etheric Realm ?).

I've run the "OF Intention Repeater.exe" file during approximatively 8 hours this last night. On this morning there were a huge blue hole over, with a diameter of approximatively 30 to 40 kilometers. There were orgonite devices around (some towerbusters and a Mini-PW from Orgonise-Africa that was powered by a software frequency generator with 963Hz + 528Hz). I still don't know if the program alone has induced the blue hole, or if it is the program + the orgonite devices around that have induced that.

I've had a feedback from Thomas Sweet (that is the first one that has programmed a software Intention Repeater at https://github.com/tsweet77) and he wrote me that : "I ran your program and can definitely feel it."

I'm very happy that he gave me this feedback. I'll then go on this experiment that I think/feel is more oriented "Information Theory" such as the work done by "Jacques Benveniste" around "The Memory Of Water" (https://books.google.fr/books/about/Ma_v%C3%A9rit%C3%A9_sur_la_M%C3%A9moire_de_l_eau.html?id=oKyz0ggBFpoC&printsec=frontcover&source=kp_read_button&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false).

If you need to analyze the .exe file https://opentip.kaspersky.com/

Possible options :

--help : Show help.

--intention "THE INTENT" : Set a specific intent. If not specified then default intention is "DIVINE LOVE".

--maxcounter 500 : Set the maximum of repeats (in millions, multiplied by multiplication factor).

--multiplicationfactor : Set the multiplication factor (default is actually 128, better is 256 on my HP EliteBook laptop).

--showcounter : Show live counter (in millions, eg. 1M = 1 million).


IMPORTANT : Don't set the multiplication factor too high because it can cause your computer to hang (because of CPU saturation). I suggest that if the default value works fine then you increase it to 256, then 512, then 1024 etc... On a high performance computer I use, the value of 1200 is the best one. I'll try to add a function to find the best value for your hardware. It also depends on the length of the intention. If the intention is long then you should decrease the multiplication factor.


# About the Android application (OF_Intention_Repeater.apk) :

This is an alpha release version. The multiplication factor is 128. There are 3 buttons : "Start processing" that starts the intention repeats, "Set intention" that sets your intention (before pressing "Start processing" or even after "Start processing" has been pressed), "Get intention" to see the current intention set. 

Installation of this APK needs you to authorize "unknown sources".
